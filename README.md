Office Cheets
=============

A colleague has sent you an Excel spreadsheet as an attachment in a Google Chat
message. You don’t have a Microsoft Excel license, and would like to investigate
the spreadsheet using Google Sheets. But clicking on the attachment in Google
Chat only gives you a read-only preview of the spreadsheet. Since the attachment
isn’t in Google Drive, you aren’t able to open it in the Google editor.

This extension adds a button to Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft
Powerpoint attachments in Google Chat. Clicking the button uploads the
attachment to your Google Drive, and opens it in a new tab using Google Docs.
